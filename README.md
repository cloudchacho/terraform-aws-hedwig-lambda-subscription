Hedwig Lambda Subscription Terraform module
===========================================

[Hedwig](https://github.com/cloudchacho/hedwig) is a inter-service communication bus that works on AWS SQS/SNS, while keeping things pretty simple and
straight forward. It uses [json schema](http://json-schema.org/) draft v4 for schema validation so all incoming
and outgoing messages are validated against pre-defined schema.

This module provides a custom [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) modules for deploying Hedwig infrastructure that
creates Hedwig subscriptions for Hedwig consumer apps hosted on AWS Lambda.

## Usage

```hcl
module "topic-dev-user-updated-v1" {
  source = "cloudchacho/hedwig-topic/aws"
  topic  = "dev-user-updated-v1"
}

resource "aws_lambda_function" "dev-myFunction" {
  ...
}
  
module "sub-dev-myapp-dev-user-updated" {
  source             = "cloudchacho/hedwig-lambda-subscription/aws"
  function           = "${aws_lambda_function.dev-myFunction.arn}"
  function_name      = "${aws_lambda_function.dev-myFunction.function_name}"
  function_qualifier = "deployed"

  topic              = "${module.topic-dev-user-updated-v1.arn}"
}
```
